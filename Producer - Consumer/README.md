# Producer Consumer Problem

Producer consumer problem is a classical synchronization problem. We can solve this problem by using semaphores.        
Problem Statement – We have a buffer of fixed size. A producer can produce an item and can place in the buffer. A consumer can pick items and can consume them. We need to ensure that when a producer is placing an item in the buffer, then at the same time consumer should not consume any item. In this problem, buffer is the critical section.

To solve this problem, we need two counting semaphores – Full and Empty. “Full” keeps track of number of items in the buffer at any given time and “Empty” keeps track of number of unoccupied slots.
